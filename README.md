# Multi-Threaded-Merge-Sort-in-C
A POSIX Multi-Threaded Merge Sort program implemented in C designed for Linux distributions.

This program is a POSIX multithreaded sorting program that divides a list of integers in to 2 smaller lists and sorts each list with two separate worker threads.  

Then the lists are merged together into a sorted list by a third worker thread.
